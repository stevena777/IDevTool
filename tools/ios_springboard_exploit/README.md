# iOS 26.2 SpringBoard Exploit Toolkit

**Target:** iPhone 15, iOS 26.2, locked out ("iPhone unavailable")
**Exploit:** UI state machine race condition via SpringBoard glitch
**Status:** Active research/exploitation toolkit

## Overview

This toolkit exploits a UI state machine bug in iOS 26.2 where triggering power-off and emergency call simultaneously causes SpringBoard to enter a confused state, potentially bypassing lock enforcement on USB services.

## The Vulnerability

When the lockout screen ("iPhone unavailable") is displayed, triggering the following sequence causes a UI glitch:

1. Press Volume UP + Volume DOWN + Side Button (power off screen)
2. Immediately tap "Emergency" button
3. UI glitches: lockout message disappears, blank screen with no time/UI

**Hypothesis:** SpringBoard's state machine confusion may cause `lockdownd` to allow USB service connections without proper authentication checks.

## Toolkit Components

### C++ Tools (Fast, Real-time)

- **`usb_monitor.exe`** - Continuously monitors for iPhone USB connection
  - Detects device instantly when connected
  - Checks pairing status
  - Attempts lockdown handshake
  - Reports if device is accessible

- **`service_probe.exe`** - Probes iOS services for accessibility
  - Tests AFC (Apple File Conduit) - file system access
  - Tests House Arrest - app sandbox access
  - Tests Installation Proxy - installed app info
  - Reports which services are exploitable

### Python Tools (Comprehensive)

- **`springboard_exploit.py`** - Full exploitation orchestration
  - Monitors for device connection
  - Attempts all exploitation vectors
  - Tries to extract data via AFC/backup
  - Logs everything to file

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the toolkit

```bash
cd ios_springboard_exploit
make
```

### 2. Start monitoring (Terminal 1)

```bash
./usb_monitor.exe
```

### 3. Trigger the glitch on iPhone

While "iPhone unavailable" is showing:
- Press **Volume UP + Volume DOWN + Side Button** together
- Immediately tap **Emergency**
- Screen should glitch (no time, no UI)
- Keep device in this state

### 4. Probe services (Terminal 2)

If device detected in step 2:
```bash
./service_probe.exe
```

### 5. Full exploitation (if services accessible)

```bash
python springboard_exploit.py
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Best Case (Exploit Success)
```
[SUCCESS] ✓✓✓ AFC ACCESS GRANTED!
[SUCCESS] File system is accessible!
```
→ Can mount iPhone filesystem and extract all data

### Good Case (Partial Access)
```
[INFO] Device info accessible
[INFO] Installation proxy accessible
```
→ Some services available, keep trying with different glitch timing

### Failure Case
```
[ERROR] Lockdown handshake failed
[INFO] Device is locked
```
→ Trigger glitch again, experiment with button timing

## Data Extraction (If AFC Accessible)

If service probe shows AFC success:

```bash
# Mount iPhone filesystem
mkdir /mnt/iphone
ifuse /mnt/iphone

# Navigate and copy data
cd /mnt/iphone
ls -la

# Copy everything
cp -r /mnt/iphone/* ./recovered_data/
```

Or use backup:
```bash
idevicebackup2 backup --full ./iphone_backup
```

## Technical Details

### Why This Works (Theory)

Normal lock flow:
```
[Device Locked] → User connects USB → lockdownd checks auth
→ Auth fails → Deny all services
```

Glitched flow:
```
[SpringBoard confused] → UI state undefined → lockdownd starts
→ Auth check skipped? → Services available
```

### Similar Historical Exploits

- iOS 6.1.2 - Emergency call bypass
- iOS 12.1 - FaceTime bypass
- iOS 10.1 - Hey Siri bypass
- All exploited UI state confusion

### Race Condition Window

When SpringBoard crashes/glitches:
1. Lock screen UI disappears (observed)
2. SpringBoard process may restart (unconfirmed)
3. lockdownd daemon state unclear (target)
4. If lockdownd restarts without checking device lock state → services accessible

## Troubleshooting

### "No device detected"
- Try different USB port (not hub)
- Try different USB cable
- Check Windows Device Manager for iPhone
- Make sure device is not in recovery mode

### "Lockdown handshake failed"
- Device is properly locked (exploit failed)
- Try glitch again with different timing
- Try: Emergency first, THEN power off
- Try: Power off first, THEN emergency

### Glitch stops working
- Device may have auto-locked
- Force restart: Vol UP, Vol DOWN, hold Side button
- Wait for boot to "iPhone unavailable"
- Try again

## Safety Notes

✓ All tools are **read-only** - cannot erase data
✓ No recovery mode commands - won't trigger restore
✓ No passcode attempts - won't cause wipe
✓ Pure USB service exploitation

⚠️ Do NOT run passcode brute force while doing this
⚠️ Do NOT enter DFU/recovery mode manually
⚠️ Keep device charged and connected

## Next Steps If This Fails

1. **Heap spray attack** - Crash SpringBoard to corrupt memory
2. **Checkra1n variants** - Look for A17 bootrom exploits (unlikely)
3. **Physical extraction** - Chip-off forensics ($50k+)
4. **Professional forensics** - Cellebrite/GrayKey ($10k+)

## Success Criteria

- ✓ Device detected via USB while glitched
- ✓ Lockdown handshake succeeds
- ✓ AFC service accessible
- ✓ File system mountable
- ✓ **Data recovered**
